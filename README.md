# Fraud Detection Project - Supervised Classification

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a supervised classification project focused on fraud detection within financial transactions. The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent transactions, mitigating financial losses, and improving security within financial systems.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project comprises historical transactional data encompassing various features like transaction amounts, timestamps, payment methods, and customer demographics. Each transaction is labeled as genuine or fraudulent, forming the basis for a supervised learning approach.

## Files included
- `Fraud_detection_ML_model_by_Trishita.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
- `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVS9lTyeNJj9V3pfxX_rO4YwXwHxXb-T/view?usp=sharing`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, outlining the dataset, approach, and key outcomes.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Comprehensive exploration and preprocessing tasks to ensure the dataset is suitable for model development.
2. **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Creation of new features and selection of relevant variables to capture predictive information related to fraudulent activities.
3. **Model Development and Evaluation**: Implementation and training of various supervised classification algorithms, followed by evaluation of model performance and selection of the most effective solution for fraud detection.

## Results
The successful development of an effective fraud detection model promises reduced financial losses, improved security within financial systems, and bolstered customer trust and confidence.

## To Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the relevant packages outlined in `requirements.txt`.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook `Fraud_detection_ML_model_by_Trishita.ipynb` to replicate the model development and evaluation process.

## Conclusion
The implemented model demonstrates the potential to significantly reduce financial losses resulting from fraudulent activities, thereby enhancing the overall security and integrity of financial transactions.
